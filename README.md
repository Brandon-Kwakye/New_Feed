# News_Feed
Hi!
This is the NewsFeed app which displays news feeds and their users
You can get started by setting up a virtual environment by running: python3 -m venv venv
then activate the virtual environment by running: source venv/bin/activate (macOS) or source venv/Scripts/activate.bat (windows)
then install the needed packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
then run: python manage.py makemigrations
then run: python manage.py migrate
then create a super user: python manage.py createsuperuser
then run your server: python manage.py runserver
then go into your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000/admin/
once in your admin panel, add a few posts to have some data to work with
Then you need to run the server!

Next you need to have an android emulator open and currently Booted up and running
In a seperate Terminal You need to navigate into the newsfeed directory then run the command flutter run and wait for the connection this will take some time

On the app you can then press the refresh button and see the newsfeed articles pop up

If you need any help you can contact me at brankwa2@gmail.com
